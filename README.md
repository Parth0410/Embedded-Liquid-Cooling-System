# Liquid-Cooling-using-Peltier-Tile
To maintain the Temperature of the water in the bottle.

About this Project:-

The Peltier Tile is the module which has two sides, one becomes cold and other heats up on applying the certain voltage. The main Objective of the project is to make a Liquid Cooler using a Peltier Tile. In this, the base is created which has the Microcontroller, Cooling Fan, and the Temperature sensors which continuously detects and display the temperature of the water as well as of the base in the display.  
As the temp. of water reaches the threshold level i.e., 15 ºC, the Fan and Peltier Tile stops working, and as the temp. again reaches above the threshold i.e., 25 ºC, both again starts working. This will help the battery to work for long duration and resulting the Water remains Cool.
