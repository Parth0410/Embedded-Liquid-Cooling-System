Here for this project I designed my own PCB for microcontroller board as well as for the Boost circuit.
The purpose of designing my own PCB is to consider the size of PCB which should not be bigger than the base of the water bottle besause the development board are too big for this.

So, the details like block diagram, all data sheets required, circuit diagram, component list with values and their component code and the other required things are attached in this.
